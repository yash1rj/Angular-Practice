<h1>{{title}}!</h1>
<!--
We have created a local variable, #child, on the tag <child-component>. The “child” is called template reference variable, which now represents the child component
-->
<!--
Now you can use the local variable elsewhere in the template to refer to the child component methods and properties as shown below
-->
<p> current count is {{child.count}} </p>
<button (click)="child.increment()">Increment</button>
<button (click)="child.decrement()">decrement</button>
<child-component #child></child-component>
